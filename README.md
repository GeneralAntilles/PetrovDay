Petrov Day
==========

This is a fork of the original Petrov Day ceremony with changes for COVID-19.

The original ceremony is designed for groups of 5-10 people and is typically performed indoors at a table. To better accommodate social distancing guidelines for COVID-19, we have updated the ceremony to be outdoors, and made equipment and ceremony changes that hew to the intentions of the original while following social distancing guidelines.

## Recommendations

* Conduct the ceremony outside
* Forgo the potluck
* All participants wear a mask
* A 6-foot buffer around each participant should be kept at all times
* Minimize handling of ceremony equipment by multiple people
* Start the ceremony at sunset
* Designate a Keeper of the Flame to perform most of the candle actions
